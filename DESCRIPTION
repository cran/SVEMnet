Description: Tools for fitting self-validated ensemble models (SVEM; Lemkus et al. (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.chemolab.2021.104439>) in small-sample design-of-experiments and related chemometric workflows, using elastic net and relaxed elastic net regression via 'glmnet' (Friedman et al. (2010) <doi:10.18637/jss.v033.i01>). Fractional random-weight bootstraps with anti-correlated validation copies are used to tune penalty paths by validation-weighted AIC/BIC. Supports Gaussian and binomial responses, deterministic expansion helpers for shared factor spaces, prediction with bootstrap uncertainty, and a random-search optimizer that respects mixture/simplex constraints and combines multiple responses via Derringer-Suich desirability functions. Also includes a permutation-based whole-model test for Gaussian SVEM fits (Karl (2024) <doi:10.1016/j.chemolab.2024.105122>). Some parts of the package code were drafted with assistance from generative AI tools.
