# NEWS for SVEMnet
[2.3.1]
- Improvements to svem_random_table_multi() and svem_optimize_random()

[2.2.4]
- Added new functions to automatically build interaction and curvature effects from list of main effects. Added a Monte Carlo optimization function. Removed wGIC objective.

[2.1.2]
- Added relaxed option to SVEMnet, default to TRUE. Default objective "auto" uses weighted BIC when the number of rows of the model matrix is <= 1.3 times the number of columns, and weighted AIC otherwise.

[1.4.0]
- Add two experimental functions allowing for whole-model testing with mixture factors.

[1.3.1]
- Code changes to handle edge cases.

[1.3.0]

- Added examples to vignette

[1.2.1]
- Corrected bug in predict() introduced in 1.1.1
- Added svem_significance_test_parallel
- Added svem_significance_test_parallel to vignette

[1.1.1]
- Changed default for `predict()` to `debias=FALSE`.
- Changed default to `objective="wAIC"` for `weight_scheme="SVEM"`.
- Added SVEMnet Vignette

[1.0.3]
