}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula specifying the model to be fitted.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the model.}

\item{nBoot}{Number of bootstrap iterations (default is 200).}

\item{glmnet_alpha}{Elastic Net mixing parameter(s) (default is \code{c(0, 0.5, 1)}).
Can be a vector of alpha values, where \code{alpha = 1} corresponds to Lasso and \code{alpha = 0} corresponds to Ridge regression.}

\item{weight_scheme}{Weighting scheme for SVEM (default is "SVEM"). Valid options are "SVEM", "FWR", and "Identity".
"FWR" calculates the Fractional Weight Regression (Xu et al., 2020) and is included for demonstration;
"SVEM" generally provides better performance."Identity" simply sets the training and validation weights to 1. Use with \code{nBoot = 1} and \code{objective = "wAIC"} to get an elastic net fit on the training data using AIC.}

\item{objective}{Objective function for selecting lambda (default is "wAIC"). Valid options are "wAIC" and "wSSE".
The "w" refers to "weighted" validation.}

\item{standardize}{logical. Passed to \code{glmnet} to control standardization (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying \code{glmnet()} function.}

\description{
Wrapper for 'glmnet' (Friedman et al. 2010) to fit an ensemble of Elastic Net models using the Self-Validated Ensemble Model method (SVEM, Lemkus et al. 2021).
Allows searching over multiple alpha values in the Elastic Net penalty.
}
\details{
The Self-Validated Ensemble Model (SVEM, Lemkus et al., 2021) framework provides a bootstrap approach to improve predictions from various base learning models, including Elastic Net regression as implemented in `glmnet`. SVEM is particularly suited for situations where a complex response surface is modeled with relatively few experimental runs.

In each of the `nBoot` iterations, SVEMnet applies random exponentially distributed weights to the observations. Anti-correlated weights are used for validation.

SVEMnet allows for the Elastic Net mixing parameter (`glmnet_alpha`) to be a vector, enabling the function to search over multiple `alpha` values within each bootstrap iteration. Within each iteration, the model is fit for each specified `alpha`, and the best `alpha` is selected based on the specified `objective`.

objective options:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"wSSE"}}{Weighted Sum of Squared Errors. Selects the lambda that minimizes the weighted validation error without penalizing model complexity. While this may lead to models that overfit when the number of parameters is large relative to the number of observations, SVEM mitigates overfitting (high prediction variance) by averaging over multiple bootstrap models. This is the objective function used by Lemkus et al. (2021) with \code{weight_scheme="SVEM"}}
  \item{\code{"wAIC"}}{Weighted Akaike Information Criterion. Balances model fit with complexity by penalizing the number of parameters. It is calculated as \code{AIC = n \* log(wSSE / n) + 2 \* k}, where \code{wSSE} is the weighted sum of squared errors, \code{n} is the number of observations, and \code{k} is the number of parameters with nonzero coefficients. Typically used with \code{weight_scheme="FWR"} or \code{weight_scheme="Identity"}}
}

weight_scheme options:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"SVEM"}}{Uses anti-correlated fractional weights for training and validation sets, improving model generalization by effectively simulating multiple training-validation splits (Lemkus et al. (2021)). Published results (Lemkus et al. (2021), Karl (2024)) utilize \code{objective="wSSE"}. However, unpublished simulation results suggest improved performance from using \code{objective="wAIC"} with \code{weight_scheme="SVEM"}. See the SVEMnet Vignette for details.}
  \item{\code{"FWR"}}{Fractional Weight Regression as described by Xu et al. (2020). Weights are the same for both training and validation sets. This method does not provide the self-validation benefits of SVEM but is included for comparison.  Used with \code{objective="wAIC"}.}
  \item{\code{"Identity"}}{Uses weights of 1 for both training and validation. This uses the full dataset for both training and validation, effectively disabling the self-validation mechanism. Use with \code{objective="wAIC"} and \code{nBoot=1} to fit the Elastic Net on the AIC of the training data.}
}

A debiased fit is output (along with the standard fit). This is provided to allow the user to match the output of JMP, which returns a debiased fit whenever \code{nBoot>=10}. \\ https://www.jmp.com/support/help/en/18.1/?utm_source=help&utm_medium=redirect#page/jmp/overview-of-selfvalidated-ensemble-models.shtml. The debiasing coefficients are always calculated by SVEMnet(), and the predict() function determines whether the raw or debiased predictions are returned via its \code{debias} argument. The default is \code{debias=FALSE}, based on performance on unpublished simulation results.

The output includes:
**Model Output:**
The returned object is a list of class \code{svem_model}, containing the following components:
\itemize{
  \item \code{parms}: Averaged coefficients across all bootstrap iterations.
  \item \code{debias_fit}: The debiasing linear model fit (if applicable). This is a linear model of the form \code{y ~ y_pred}, used to adjust the predictions and reduce bias.
  \item \code{coef_matrix}: Matrix of coefficients from each bootstrap iteration. Each row corresponds to a bootstrap iteration, and each column corresponds to a model coefficient.
  \item \code{nBoot}: Number of bootstrap iterations performed.
  \item \code{glmnet_alpha}: The Elastic Net mixing parameter(s) used. This is the \code{alpha} parameter from \code{glmnet}.
  \item \code{best_alphas}: The best \code{alpha} values selected during the fitting process for each bootstrap iteration.
  \item \code{best_lambdas}: The best \code{lambda} values selected during the fitting process for each bootstrap iteration.
  \item \code{weight_scheme}: The weighting scheme used in SVEM. Indicates whether \code{"SVEM"}, \code{"FWR"}, or \code{"Identity"} weights were used.
  \item \code{actual_y}: The response vector used in the model.
  \item \code{training_X}: The predictor matrix used in the model.
  \item \code{y_pred}: The predicted response values from the ensemble model before debiasing.
  \item \code{y_pred_debiased}: The debiased predicted response values (if debiasing is applied). Adjusted predictions using the \code{debias_fit} model.
  \item \code{nobs}: The number of observations in the dataset.
  \item \code{nparm}: The number of parameters (including the intercept), calculated as \code{ncol(X) + 1}.
  \item \code{formula}: The formula used in the model fitting.
  \item \code{terms}: The terms object extracted from the model frame.
